General process for running the bot is as follows:

1. Run Murkrow to activate the bot and generate a list of commands with murkrow using the gift command in the server

2. Save the generated file and copy the file path

3. Run Smeargle, paste file path, place mouse cursor in discord chat box and press the hotkey to start the automated command input

4. Non-unique items have to be input one by one and manually confirmed in discord because unbelievaboat sucks ass, so a separate section is included where I can just paste each of them
